Spam classification using traditional ML classifiers and using DL with GloVe embedding

* Dataset link : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection
* Glove model : https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/  (download glove.6B.100d.txt)
* Basic preprocessing steps on the dataset: Punctuation removal, stop words removal and stemming 

* Two classification models were developed:
    1) Using traditional Machine Learning Classifiers from SKLearn namely Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, MultinomialNB, Decision Tree, KNN and RandomForest
    2) Using Deep learning with Glove embedding layer
    
* Logistic Regression and MultinomialNB gave the highest testing accuracy of 98%
